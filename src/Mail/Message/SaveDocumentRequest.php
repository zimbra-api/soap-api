/**
 * SaveDocumentRequest class
 * Save Document
 * One mechanism for Creating and updating a Document is:
 * - Use FileUploadServlet to upload the document
 * - Call SaveDocumentRequest using the upload-id returned from FileUploadServlet.
 *
 * A Document represents a file.  A file can be created by uploading to FileUploadServlet.  Or it can refer to an
 * attachment of an existing message.
 *
 * Documents are versioned.  The server maintains the metadata of each version, such as by who and when the version
 * was edited, and the fragment.
 *
 * When updating an existing Document, the client must supply the id of Document, and the last known version of the
 * document in the 'ver' attribute.  This is used to prevent blindly overwriting someone else's change made after
 * the version this update was based upon.  The update will succeed only when the last known version supplied by the
 * client matches the current version of the item identified by item-id.
 *
 * Saving a new document, as opposed to adding a revision of existing document, should leave the id and ver fields
 * empty in the request.  Then the server checks and see if the named document already exists, if so returns an error.
 *
 * The request should contain either an <upload> element or a <msg> element, but not both.
 * When <upload> is used, the document should first be uploaded to FileUploadServlet, and then use the
 * upload-id from the FileUploadResponse.
 *
 * When <m> is used, the document is retrieved from an existing message in the mailbox, identified by the
 * msg-id and part-id.  The content of the document can be inlined in the <content> element.
 * The content can come from another document / revision specified in the <doc> sub element.
